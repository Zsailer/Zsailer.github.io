      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.&amp;rdquo;
 A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join many members of the Project Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s core development team in Washington DC for our annual team meeting. A huge thank you to Dr. Lorena Barba for hosting our team at George Washington University for the week.
This was an incredible experience.
I counted ~20 core contributors representing 9 different countries in the room.</description>
