      <description>&amp;ldquo;If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.&amp;rdquo;
 A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join many members of the Project Jupyter&amp;rsquo;s core development team in Washington DC for our annual team meeting.
This was an incredible experience.
This was critical meeting, as we discussed broke ground on various critical conversations about the sustainibility of the project.
One thing is certain: this team cares deeply about its community.</description>
