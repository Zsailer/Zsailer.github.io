      <description>Recently, there has been a lot of discussion on whether the hype around Jupyter Notebooks is deserved.
Critics say that Notebooks are not actually good for software development. In fact, they actually encourage bad software engineering/development practices. This is a fair criticism, and I actually agree. (I recommend watching the talk, &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t like notebooks.&amp;rdquo; to hear some common criticisms).
The dominant counter argument I hear is&amp;ndash;
 The interactivity offered by Notebooks is a &amp;ldquo;net win&amp;rdquo;.</description>
