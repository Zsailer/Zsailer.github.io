      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something I’m learning as I attempt to write more often…
 There’s a lot of “not writing” that happens in the early stages of writing.

It takes time to formulate thoughts, reason through ideas, articulate concepts and put them down on a page. As a result, that page stays blank for a long time (or gets littered with useless fragments).</description>
