      <description>Here&amp;rsquo;s something I’m learning as I attempt to write more often…
 There’s a lot of “not writing” that happens in the early stages of writing.
 While that’s probably obvious to more seasoned writers, it’s something I’m just now realizing has been a road block for me.
It takes time to formulate thoughts, reason through ideas, articulate concepts and put them down on a page. As a result, that page stays blank for a long time (or gets littered with useless fragments).</description>

      <description>Finally starting a blog. Thank you to Leticia Portella and Saul Shanabrook for pushing to make it happened.
I&amp;rsquo;m planning to use this site to share three major types of content.
 I&amp;rsquo;ll announce software that I&amp;rsquo;ve published or review software someone else published.
 I&amp;rsquo;ll highlight things I come across in basic science and research domains. Since my background is in science, I&amp;rsquo;ll use this blog to stay connected to that community.</description>
