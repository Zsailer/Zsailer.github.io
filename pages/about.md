Hello, my name is Zach. Welcome to my personal site. I'm glad you're here!

*A little bit about me*

I'm a open-source software developer and core developer of [Project Jupyter](https://jupyter.org/). At Jupyter, we're creating open-source software, open-standards, and services for interactive computing. I'm extremely proud of what our team has accomplished and what we're aving. If you haven't heard of Jupyter, you should check it out!

I got my Ph.D. at University of Oregon in [Dr. Mike Harms](https://www.evolutionarybiochemist.org/)' evolutionary biophysics lab. Mike's lab is interested in understanding how proteins--the very molecules that sustain all living organisms--evolved to form a diverse toolkit to carry out all the necessary functions for life. The lab combine methods from evolutionary genetics, molecular biology, biochemisty, and physics to understand how proteins can accumulate mutations over time and acquire new functions. My work, in particular, explored what happens when one or more mutations change the effect of another mutation, a phenomenon called [**epistasis**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Epistasis). If you're interested further, feel free to skim my publications listed [here](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=zpX45J8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=ao).
