If you want to go far, go together.\u0026rdquo;\n A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join many members of the Project Jupyter\u0026rsquo;s core development team in Washington DC for our annual team meeting.\nThis was an incredible experience.\nThis was critical meeting, as we discussed broke ground on various critical conversations about the sustainibility of the project.\nOne thing is certain: this team cares deeply about its community.\nI was surprised by how many times phrases like \u0026ldquo;empower everyone\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;for the greater good\u0026rdquo; were mentioned thoughout the week. There\u0026rsquo;s one thing that is certain; the Jupyter team cares deeply its community.\nA global community doesn\u0026rsquo;t come without it\u0026rsquo;s challenges. For example, a central theme throughout the week was how to build a scalable governance model for Project Jupyter\u0026ndash;an organization that has many moving parts. We acknowledged that we struggle with the \u0026ldquo;tyranny of structurelessness\u0026rdquo;.\nProject Jupyter has many stake-holders that span many fields. There are partners in industry, like IBM, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc., and in academia. Industry stakeholders can often move fast.\n","href":"/jupyter/jupyter-team-meeting/","title":"Jupyter Team Meeting 2019"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/","title":"Authors"},{"content":"","href":"/categories/","title":"Categories"},{"content":"","href":"/page/","title":"Pages"},{"content":"","href":"/search/","title":"Search"},{"content":"","href":"/series/","title":"Series"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/","title":"Tags"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/intro/","title":"intro"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/jupyter/","title":"jupyter"},{"content":"","href":"/tags/open-source-community/","title":"open-source community"},{"content":"","href":"/authors/zsailer/","title":"zsailer"}]
