If you want to go far, go together.\u0026rdquo;\n A few weeks ago, I had the opportunity to join many members of the Project Jupyter\u0026rsquo;s core development team in Washington DC for our annual team meeting. A huge thank you to Dr. Lorena Barba for hosting our team at George Washington University for the week.\nThis was an incredible experience.\nI counted ~20 core contributors representing 9 different countries in the room. Both new and long-time contributors were present. Fernando Perez, the creator of IPython (in 2001) and co-creator of Project Jupyter, was there, as well as Letitia Portella, a new team member that joined through Outreachy four months earlier. The best part\u0026ndash;it did not matter what your background was; everyone had an voice.\nI won\u0026rsquo;t much time to talking about the specific things we discussed during the week (you can find more detail in the links at the bottom). I will just say\u0026ndash;I was amazed by how many times phrases like \u0026ldquo;empower everyone\u0026rdquo; and \u0026ldquo;for the greater good\u0026rdquo; were mentioned thoughout the week.\nThere\u0026rsquo;s one thing that is certain; the Jupyter team cares deeply for its community.\nMost of our conversations were centered around one question: how do we build a governance model that scales and protects Project Jupyter\u0026rsquo;s community?\nThe Jupyter ecosystem is a global community; that comes with many challenges. Until now, Jupyter has suffered from the \u0026ldquo;tyranny of structurelessness\u0026rdquo;. But as Jupyter finds itself pulled by various, major stake-holders like IBM, Netflix, Amazon, Microsoft, Google, etc., the community will need to invest time, energy, and initiative into establishing a structure that protects and sustains its members. During our week together, we constructed some actionable next steps. Now, we just need to make them happen. To keep up on things that are happening around Jupyter, I strongly recommend you check out our Discourse page.\nFurther reading I recommend from this week:\n Chris Holdgraf\u0026rsquo;s thoughts: https://predictablynoisy.com/jupyter-team-meeting-2019 Jupyter Discourse thread: https://discourse.jupyter.org/t/2019-in-person-team-meeting-updates-and-notes/458  ","href":"/jupyter/jupyter-team-meeting/","title":"Jupyter Team Meeting 2019"},{"content":"Finally starting a blog. Thank you to Letitia Portella and Saul Shanabrook for pushing to make it happened.\nI\u0026rsquo;m planning to use this site to share three major types of content.\n I\u0026rsquo;ll announce software that I\u0026rsquo;ve published or review software someone else published.\n I\u0026rsquo;ll highlight things I come across in basic science and research domains. Since my background is in science, I\u0026rsquo;ll use this blog to stay connected to that community.\n I\u0026rsquo;ll try to record useful tricks, hints, and details I found useful in my own pursuit to be a better developer.
